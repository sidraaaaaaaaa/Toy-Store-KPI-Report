Toy Store KPI Report
Project Overview: I developed an interactive KPI report for a toy store chain in Mexico to help the leadership team monitor key metrics, track trends, and enable data-driven decision-making. The report provided actionable insights into business performance and highlighted areas for improvement.

Identifying relationships among data tables.

Profiling data for transaction counts, store counts, and product pricing ranges.

Adding calculated columns for "Start of Month" and "Start of Week" for time-based analysis.

Built a structured data model following best practices for efficient analysis:

Established relationships using a star schema between sales, products, stores, and calendar tables.

Hid foreign keys for a cleaner report view.

3. Adding Measures and Calculated Fields
